Tim, 
  Here are the details of the port to the SGI (at least most of them I hope).
The only problem remaining in the driver is one which you may be able to help
me with.  In the routine PGCURSE the driver is expected to return x and y 
WORLD coordinates, and I am returning the coordinates in the graphics window,
relative to the lower left corner of the window.  Is there an easy way to 
convert between the two?  I'm sending the driver anyway, maybe you know someone
who may be able to solve the problem.

  I'm also sending the terminal I/O routines since these were also largely 
rewritten.

---------------These are a few helpful hints that should allow you to port PGPLOT to the
Silicon Graphics Personal Iris.

Most of these changes (I must admit) were suggested by the document found in the
file dec3100/README within the PGPLOT directory.  Some of the problems there did
not appear here and vice versa.

To begin I copied Makefile.SUN to Makefile.IRIS so as to make the needed changes
with the opportunity for recovery. 

The warning "dummy procedure not declared EXTERNAL.  Code may be wrong."
was given for lines 45 and 46 of pgfunt.f, line 55 of pgfunx.f, and
line 52 of pgfuny.f.  warning ignored after checking the appropriate
source files.

The error "impossible element in concatenation" was given for line 146
of tedriv.f and line 238 of vtdriv.f.  possible bug in compiler.  solved
by modifying the relevant lines to not use string concatenation.

it is necessary to compile the fortran source code with a -static flag.
this declares all function variables to be static (equivalent to the
save command) instead of automatic.  this is especially important for
the various drivers which implicitly rely upon the function variables
being static.

The compile flags used were "-O2 -static -u" for f77 and "-O2" for cc.
"-O0" and "-g" also work as expected and are useful for debugging.
i have not tried using the "-O3" flag.

Removed svdriv (the SunView driver) from the list of device drivers.  irdriv
(my IRIS driver) was later added to the list of drivers.

grexecSUN.f was copied into grexecIRIS.f and then modified to call the IRIS 
driver (irdriv) in place of the SunView driver.

One rather sweeping change.  Routines lib$get_vm and lib$free_vm needed to be
renamed as the SGI C compiler could not handle the '$' in a routine name.  the
'$' was replaced with '_' and calls to the routine were modified in the
following routines:
     gfdriv.f       imdriv.f      pxdriv.f
     redriv.f       tedriv.f      tfdriv.f
     vedriv.f       vvdriv.f

The routine gr_termio.c was rewritten into gr_termioiris.c since the former
used BSD terminal I/O and the IRIS has no such thing.  

Makefiles in both the `fonts' and `examples' directories were modified to use 
the gl libraries to do graphics.

List of modified files:
=======================
Makefile.IRIS (from Makefile.SUN)
lib_get_vm.c
gfdriv.f
imdriv.f
pxdriv.f
redriv.f
tedriv.f
tfdriv.f
vedriv.f
vvdriv.f
gr_termioiris.c (from gr_termio.c)
grexecIRIS.f    (from grexecSUN.f)
fonts/Makefile.IRIS
examples/Makefile.IRIS

The driver for SGI's gl has about the same functionality as the SunView driver
with a few additions (linestyles and line thicknesses are handled in the SGI
graphics hardware).  When a PGPLOT program is executed it retains control of
the shell window it was executed from.  This was necessry to allow keyboard input 
by users.
