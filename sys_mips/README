PGPLOT software port to MIPS machine running ULTRIX and XWINDOWS

The sys_mips directory contains all additions to the PGPLOT code
to make it run on a Decstation 5000, running the ultrix
operating system and X11R5 X-windows. The changes are
as follows:

o Machine-dependent fortran code was copied from the sys_dec3100
directory of the pgplot49e release:

grprom.f        tedriv.f
grgcom.f        grvt03.f        vtdriv.f

o Additional machine-dependent files were copied from the sys_sun
directory:

gr_termio.c     grgcom.f        grgmsg.f        grprom.f        grtter.f
grdate.f        grgenv.f        grlgtr.f        grsy00.f        gruser.f
grexec.f        grgetc.c        grmsg.f         grtermio.c      grwarn.f
grflun.f        grglun.f        groptx.f        grtrml.f

o Some files were copied also from the sys_hp directory:

Makefile	setup		makeclean	grexec.f

o The xwdriv.c code was copied from the src directory.

The following files were modified:

Makefile
setup
makeclean
grexec.f
grsy00.f
xwdriv.c

in order to specify the directory paths to use on the UNSW Decstation,
and to remove references to shareable libraries, which are
not available under ultrix. The vt125 driver was added to grexec.f.
A lib directory was created using mkdir for the libpgplot.a
archive of object modules. 

Instructions for installing PGPLOT on a MIPS machine are
in the sys_mips/Makefile. Note that you will need to correctly
set the paths in:

Makefile
setup
makeclean
grsy00.f
xwdriv.c

for PGPLOT to be installed properly on your system.
